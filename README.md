## About

Systems software engineer focused on databases, distributed systems, and performance-critical infrastructure.

I design from first principles, emphasizing correctness, predictability, and behavior under real constraints such as high concurrency, limited resources, and failure.

Current interests include transactional storage engines, concurrency control, recovery, and query execution. Most work takes the form of small prototypes and design notes exploring internal trade-offs.

Outside engineering, I enjoy table tennis, Formula 1, [nature](https://myke.pro/gallery), and travel.
