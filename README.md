## About

Software engineer focused on databases, distributed systems, and financial infrastructure.

I design from first principles, emphasizing correctness, predictability, and behavior under real constraints such as high concurrency, limited resources, and failure.

Current interests include transactional storage engines, concurrency control, recovery, query execution, and financial systems.

Outside engineering, I enjoy table tennis, Formula 1, [nature](https://myke.pro/gallery), and travel.
