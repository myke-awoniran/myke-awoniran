## About

Systems software engineer focused on databases, distributed systems, and performance-critical infrastructure.

I design systems from first principles, with emphasis on correctness, predictability, and behavior under real constraints such as high concurrency, limited resources, and failure.

Current interests include transactional storage engines, concurrency control, recovery mechanisms, and analytical query execution. Much of my work takes the form of small prototypes, experiments, and design notes exploring internal system trade-offs.

Outside engineering, I enjoy table tennis, Formula 1, nature, and travel.
